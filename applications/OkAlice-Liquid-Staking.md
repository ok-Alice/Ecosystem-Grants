# Liquid Staking - okAlice

**⚠️ okAlice TODO ⚠️**

- **Team Name:** okAlice LS
- **Payment Address:** Polkadot payment address.


## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview

The goal of this project is to create an Ink! based liquid staking DAO which will implement the following functionality:
- Users can participate in securing the network by staking their tokens.
- Receive rewards for their staked tokens.
- Receive a derivative token in exchange for the staked token, which they can use on other dapps or chains, hence the name liquid staking.
- Participate in the validator selection through an on-chain governance.

### Ink! Ecosystem Impact

Regarding the value that the Ink! ecosystem can derive from our Dapp, we plan to deploy it on Astar and hope that it will bring in a whole new wave of users into the Ink! ecosystem. Our aim is to eliminate the need for users to have technical knowledge about the back-end of the Dapp.
We will make all of our code open-source, and we plan to document our development journey through articles and videos. We hope that our Dapp can serve as an inspiration for future projects alongside the existing smart contracts.


### Project Details

**⚠️ okAlice TODO ⚠️**

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
- Do you need an audit for the contacts? **YES/NO**
(don’t add it as part of Milestones! The auditor will be chosen among Auditor track participants)
- CATEGORY: Infrastructure OR Canary Dapp OR Technical Showcase


Things that shouldn’t be part of the application:
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Team's experience

Our first project that we built in the Polkadot ecosystem was ‘Rooster Dao’. The project [won 3 prizes](https://devpost.com/software/rooster-dao?utm_campaign=winner_email&utm_content=submission_won&utm_medium=tweet&utm_source=twitter) during the Polkadot North-America hackathon in the summer of 2022:
- Winner of the community choice
- First place for the RMRK challenges
- Second place for Dao & Governance
Based on this project we have been invited by the Astar team to adapt the Rooster Dao’ contract to be usable on Swanky node.
In 2023 we participated in the Polkadot EU hackathon with a project called ‘Pallet Rent’. The project won the first prize in the NFT category.

- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to building this template,

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

**⚠️ okAlice TODO ⚠️**

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

**⚠️ okAlice TODO ⚠️**

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the level of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD.
